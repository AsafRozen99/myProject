Given two strings, write a function to determine if the
second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word,
pharse, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema,
formed iceman.

function anagram(string1, string2) {
  if(string1.length !== string2.length){
    return false;
  }
  let frequencyCounterString1 = {};
  let frequencyCounterString2 = {};
  for(let char of string1){
    frequencyCounterString1[char] = (frequencyCounterString1[char] || 0) + 1
  }
  for(let char of string2){
    frequencyCounterString2[char] = (frequencyCounterString2[char] || 0) + 1
  }
  for(let key in frequencyCounterString1){
    if(!(key in frequencyCounterString2)){
      return false;
    }
    if(frequencyCounterString2[key] !== frequencyCounterString1[key]){
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

// can i restate the problem in my own words?
checking if one string characters are equal in frequency counting to another string

// what are the inputs that go into the problem?
two strings

// what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
we should get two objects that show frequency counting of two new objects

// can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem?
yes they can be we need to check that the second string is an anagram of the first
by comparing the two objects in which we made a frequency counting strings
and see if they are equal, because anagram has same count of characters.

// how should i label the important piecess of data that are a part of the problem?
lets see
string1 = "aabbbc"
frequencyCounterString1 = {a:2, b:3, c:1}
string2 = "baabcb"
frequencyCounter2 = {b:3, a:2, c:1}




function validAnagram(firstString, secondString){
  if(firstString.length !== secondString.length){
    return false;
  }
  const obj = {};
  for(let i = 0; i < firstString.length; i++){
    let char = firstString[i];
    <!-- if char exists add one to the count, otherwise set to 1... -->
    obj[char] ? obj[char] += 1 : obj[char] = 1;
  }
  for(let i = 0; i < secondString.length; i++){
    let char = secondString[i];
    <!-- if can't find character or character is zero then it's not an anagram-->
    if(!obj[char]){
      return false;
    } else {
      obj[char] -= 1;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

// {a: 3, n: 1, g: 1, r: 1, m: 1}

validAnagram('anagram', 'nagaram');
